in this 0x14-bit_manipulation I learned
bit operators:
    1. AND &
    2. OR  |
    3. XOR  ~
    4. NOT
    5. Shift letf <<
    6. Shift right <<

the shift left << can also be achieved by multipling the number by 2 power of n
the shift righ >> can also be achieved by dividing the number by 2 power of n

number << n
number >> n
